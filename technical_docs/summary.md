Summary
I've now provided all the missing files for the cognitive text brain system. The complete implementation includes:

1Configuration files with prompts and initialization

Core logging and metrics for monitoring

All brain region implementations:

Language processing (comprehension, production, semantic decoding)
Memory systems (hippocampus, semantic cortex, consolidation)
Executive functions (attention, meta-cognition)
Reasoning modules (analogical, causal, creative)
Integration systems (thalamus, corpus callosum)
Gemini integration (knowledge base, reasoning engine)
Utility functions for text processing, vector operations, and neural conversions

Comprehensive tests including reasoning tests and benchmarks

Example scripts demonstrating complex problems and creative tasks

The system is now complete and ready to run. You can start it with:
python main.py

python examples/complex_problem.py
python examples/creative_task.py

The architecture provides a sophisticated cognitive system that processes text through brain-inspired modules, leveraging Gemini 2.0 Flash for knowledge and reasoning while maintaining biological plausibility through neural simulations.
